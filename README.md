#Simple toggle demo
##using the iotfw framework.
This demo displays a page with a button that will toggle on and off a led connected to LEDPIN (defined in the .h file).
This uses the HTML Query protocol to specify the on or off argument.
The exmaple also uses the extend the variable replacement (Token Handler) in the framwork to add the %LED% state as a variable in the HTML.
the %TIME% %TIMESTATUS% and %NETSTATE% are handled by the basic framwork.
